# 3DAppVersionSpoofer
Spoof App Version right from your 3D menu!

This tweak will NOT change any files related to your app. its all about hooking.

How to use: 
1. Activate the 3D menu by using long press on your app icon, and choose the option "Spoof App Version"
2. Set the version you want the app to think it has
3. Run the app

Pro tip: don't just spoof a random app version. go to appstore and find out which app version you would like to have.
